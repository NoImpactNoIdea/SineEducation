    SquareData(id: "dog", backgroundColor: .blue, imageName: "dog.fill", description: "Your loyal canine companion exhibits an extraordinary auditory capacity, far superior to that of humans. Dogs can discern a vast frequency range from 40 Hz to an impressive 60,000 Hz, significantly broader than the human range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Their large, mobile ears are exquisitely tuned to detect a wide spectrum of sounds, from the subtle rustle of leaves to echoes from distant calls. This acute sensitivity makes dogs exceptionally adept at interpreting environmental sounds, rendering them invaluable in various roles from companionship to security.", hertz: (15000, 20000)),
    
    SquareData(id: "cat", backgroundColor: .red, imageName: "cat.fill", description: "Your elegant feline friend possesses an exceptional auditory system that surpasses even the most sensitive human ears. Cats can perceive frequencies from 45 Hz to a remarkable 64,000 Hz, greatly extending beyond the human auditory spectrum. Their slender, pointed ears are highly attuned to detect the slightest noises, enabling them to track minute movements with extraordinary stealth. This capability allows them to excel as natural predators, quietly stalking their prey with remarkable precision.", hertz: (45, 24000)),
    
    SquareData(id: "bird", backgroundColor: .green, imageName: "bird.fill", description: "The avian realm resonates with a rich tapestry of sounds to which birds are finely attuned. They possess a remarkable auditory range, generally between 50 Hz and 12,000 Hz, though this can vary notably among species. Birds' acute hearing is essential for effective communication, navigation, and recognizing potential threats within their environment. The diverse calls and songs of birds not only facilitate communication but also play pivotal roles in mating rituals and territorial disputes.", hertz: (50, 12000)),
    
    SquareData(id: "fish", backgroundColor: .orange, imageName: "fish.fill", description: "Submerged in aquatic environments, fish experience a world abundant in auditory stimuli, which they perceive not through external ears but via specialized organs known as otoliths. These organs detect vibrations within the water, with many fish species capable of hearing frequencies ranging from 50 Hz to 3,000 Hz. This sensory adaptation enables fish to navigate their fluidic landscapes, detect predators, and communicate with peers, ensuring their survival and reproductive success.", hertz: (50, 3000)),
    
    SquareData(id: "rabbit", backgroundColor: .cyan, imageName: "hare.fill", description: "Contrary to their quiet demeanor, rabbits have a highly developed sense of hearing, enabling them to detect frequencies between 360 Hz and 42,000 Hz. Their prominent, upright ears act like sophisticated antennae, rotating to pinpoint the origin of sounds. This heightened auditory awareness is critical for detecting predators early and communicating with other rabbits, especially in the wild, where survival often hinges on swift reactions.", hertz: (360, 24000)),
    
    SquareData(id: "adult", backgroundColor: .purple, imageName: "figure", description: "As an adult human, your auditory system is adept at navigating a wide range of frequencies, typically from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. This range enables you to appreciate a diverse array of sounds from musical tones to the nuances of human speech. While not as expansive as some of your animal counterparts, the human ear is uniquely tuned to recognize patterns and nuances in speech and music, playing a critical role in communication and social interaction.", hertz: (20, 20000)),
    
    SquareData(id: "child", backgroundColor: .yellow, imageName: "figure.child", description: "In the developmental stages of early childhood, human ears undergo significant changes, enhancing their ability to discern a wide spectrum of sounds. Typically, young children have an auditory range similar to adults, from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, but with heightened sensitivity to higher frequencies. This acute hearing aids in the development of linguistic skills and can influence cognitive and social development through increased environmental awareness.", hertz: (20, 20000)),
    
    SquareData(id: "lizard", backgroundColor: .mint, imageName: "lizard.fill", description: "Lizards, with their often inconspicuous presence, rely heavily on their advanced hearing capabilities, which are crucial for survival in diverse habitats. Capable of detecting frequencies from about 100 Hz to 5,000 Hz, and sometimes higher, lizards can sense the subtlest vibrations through their specialized ear structures. These adaptations enable them to avoid predators, locate prey, and engage in social interactions through a range of auditory cues, from the faintest whisper of an insect's movement to the rustle of leaves caused by larger animals.", hertz: (100, 5000)),
