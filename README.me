The Sine Education App is designed to help users explore the hearing ranges of various animals through interactive audio generation. It utilizes specific frequency ranges to simulate how different animals perceive sound, providing an educational tool for students, teachers, and animal enthusiasts to learn more about auditory perception across species.

## Features
